I'm making a videogame! I wanted to take this chance to embrace new, modern technologies, so I'm using Firebase, Svelte, and Babylon.js.

It's a third-person action game inspired by a bunch of action titles (DMC, Kingdom Hearts, and .Hack, to name a few)

This has been many years in the making, mostly because I allowed shiny-object syndrome ðŸ˜… but I think I'm settling on a vision.

In terms of a portfolio piece, it most highlights my ability to put together non-standard tech stacks. But I would say Svelte is my **favorite** web framework so far.

As of now, you can only log in and run around. Still, I'm very proud of the work I'm putting in, so I wanted to put this portfolio piece here.

I'm not nearly ready for a public release, but I'd love to show you my latest progress!
